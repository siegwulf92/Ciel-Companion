Combat
The Order of Combat
A typical combat encounter is a clash between two sides, a flurry of weapon swings, feints, parries, footwork, and spellcasting. The game organizes the chaos of combat into a cycle of rounds and turns. A round represents about 6 seconds in the game world. During a round, each participant in a battle takes a turn.

Combat Step by Step
Determine surprise. The GM determines whether anyone involved in the combat encounter is surprised.

Establish positions. The GM decides where all the characters and monsters are located.

Roll initiative. Everyone involved in the combat encounter rolls initiative, determining the order of combatants’ turns.

Take turns. Each participant in the battle takes a turn in initiative order.

Begin the next round. When everyone involved in the combat has had a turn, the round ends. Repeat step 4 until the fighting stops.

Surprise
The GM determines who might be surprised. If neither side tries to be stealthy, they automatically notice each other. Otherwise, the GM compares the Dexterity (Stealth) checks of anyone hiding with the passive Wisdom (Perception) score of each creature on the opposing side. Any character or monster that doesn’t notice a threat is surprised at the start of the encounter.

If you’re surprised, you can’t move or take an action on your first turn of the combat, and you can’t take a reaction until that turn ends. A member of a group can be surprised even if the other members aren’t.

Initiative
Initiative determines the order of turns during combat. When combat starts, every participant makes a Dexterity check to determine their place in the initiative order. The GM ranks the combatants in order from the one with the highest Dexterity check total to the one with the lowest. This is the order in which they act during each round. The initiative order remains the same from round to round.

If a tie occurs, the GM decides the order among tied GM-controlled creatures, and the players decide the order among their tied characters.

Your Turn
On your turn, you can move a distance up to your speed and take one action. You decide whether to move first or take your action first.

Bonus Actions: You can take a bonus action only when a special ability, spell, or other feature of the game states that you can do something as a bonus action. You can take only one bonus action on your turn.

Reactions: A reaction is an instant response to a trigger of some kind, which can occur on your turn or on someone else’s. When you take a reaction, you can’t take another one until the start of your next turn.

Movement and Position
On your turn, you can move a distance up to your speed. You can break up your movement on your turn, using some of your speed before and after your action.

Difficult Terrain: Every foot of movement in difficult terrain costs 1 extra foot.

Being Prone: You can drop prone without using any of your speed. Standing up costs an amount of movement equal to half your speed. To move while prone, you must crawl. Every foot of movement while crawling costs 1 extra foot.

Flying Movement: If a flying creature is knocked prone, has its speed reduced to 0, or is otherwise deprived of the ability to move, the creature falls, unless it has the ability to hover.

Actions in Combat
When you take your action on your turn, you can take one of the actions presented here.

Attack: The most common action. With this action, you make one melee or ranged attack.

Cast a Spell: Most spells require an action to cast.

Dash: You gain extra movement for the current turn. The increase equals your speed.

Disengage: Your movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks for the rest of the turn.

Dodge: Until the start of your next turn, any attack roll made against you has disadvantage if you can see the attacker, and you make Dexterity saving throws with advantage.

Help: The creature you aid gains advantage on the next ability check it makes. Alternatively, you can aid a friendly creature in attacking a creature within 5 feet of you.

Hide: You make a Dexterity (Stealth) check in an attempt to hide.

Ready: You choose an action you will take in response to a perceivable trigger.

Search: You devote your attention to finding something.

Use an Object: You interact with a second object or use an object that requires an action.

Making an Attack
An attack has a simple structure:

Choose a target.

Determine modifiers.

Resolve the attack. You make the attack roll. On a hit, you roll damage.

Attack Rolls
To make an attack roll, roll a d20 and add the appropriate modifiers. If the total of the roll plus modifiers equals or exceeds the target’s Armor Class (AC), the attack hits.

Modifiers: The two most common modifiers are an ability modifier and a proficiency bonus.

Ability Modifier: Strength for melee weapon attacks, Dexterity for ranged weapon attacks.

Proficiency Bonus: You add your proficiency bonus if you are proficient with the weapon.

Rolling 1 or 20: A 20 on the d20 is a critical hit and always hits. A 1 on the d20 always misses.

Ranged Attacks
When you make a ranged attack, you have disadvantage on the attack roll if you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature who can see you and who isn’t incapacitated.

Melee Attacks
Used in hand-to-hand combat, a melee attack allows you to attack a foe within your reach (typically 5 feet).

Opportunity Attacks: You can make an opportunity attack when a hostile creature that you can see moves out of your reach. You use your reaction to make one melee attack against the provoking creature.

Two-Weapon Fighting: When you take the Attack action with a light melee weapon, you can use a bonus action to attack with a different light melee weapon in your other hand. You don’t add your ability modifier to the bonus attack's damage.

Grappling: You can use the Attack action to make a special melee attack, a grapple. This is a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target’s Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check.

Shoving a Creature: You can make a special melee attack to shove a creature, either to knock it prone or push it 5 feet away from you. This is a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target’s Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check.

Cover
Obstacles can provide cover, making a target harder to hit.

Half cover: +2 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws.

Three-quarters cover: +5 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws.

Total cover: Can’t be targeted directly.

Damage and Healing
Hit points represent a combination of physical and mental durability, the will to live, and luck.

Damage Rolls: Each weapon or spell specifies the damage it deals. When attacking with a weapon, you add your ability modifier to the damage.

Critical Hits: When you score a critical hit, you roll all of the attack’s damage dice twice and add them together.

Damage Resistance and Vulnerability: Resistance halves the damage. Vulnerability doubles the damage.

Healing: When a creature receives healing, hit points regained are added to its current hit points, not exceeding its maximum.

Dropping to 0 Hit Points: You either die outright or fall unconscious.

Instant Death: If damage reduces you to 0 and the remaining damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum, you die.

Falling Unconscious: If damage reduces you to 0 but fails to kill you, you fall unconscious.

Death Saving Throws: At the start of your turn with 0 hit points, you make a death saving throw (roll a d20). On a 10 or higher, you succeed. Three successes and you become stable. Three failures and you die. A roll of 1 counts as two failures. A roll of 20 regains 1 hit point.

Conditions
Blinded: A blinded creature can’t see and automatically fails any ability check that requires sight. Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature’s attack rolls have disadvantage.

Charmed: A charmed creature can’t attack the charmer or target the charmer with harmful abilities or magical effects. The charmer has advantage on any ability check to interact socially with the creature.

Deafened: A deafened creature can’t hear and automatically fails any ability check that requires hearing.

Frightened: A frightened creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while the source of its fear is within line of sight. The creature can’t willingly move closer to the source of its fear.

Grappled: A grappled creature’s speed becomes 0, and it can’t benefit from any bonus to its speed. The condition ends if the grappler is incapacitated. The condition also ends if an effect removes the grappled creature from the reach of the grappler.

Incapacitated: An incapacitated creature can’t take actions or reactions.

Invisible: An invisible creature is impossible to see without the aid of magic or a special sense. For the purpose of hiding, the creature is heavily obscured. The creature’s location can be detected by any noise it makes or any tracks it leaves. Attack rolls against the creature have disadvantage, and the creature’s attack rolls have advantage.

Paralyzed: A paralyzed creature is incapacitated and can’t move or speak. The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws. Attack rolls against the creature have advantage. Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.

Petrified: A petrified creature is transformed, along with any nonmagical object it is wearing or carrying, into a solid inanimate substance (usually stone). Its weight increases by a factor of ten, and it ceases aging. The creature is incapacitated, can’t move or speak, and is unaware of its surroundings. Attack rolls against the creature have advantage. The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws. The creature has resistance to all damage. The creature is immune to poison and disease.

Poisoned: A poisoned creature has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.

Prone: A prone creature’s only movement option is to crawl, unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition. The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls. An attack roll against the creature has advantage if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature. Otherwise, the attack roll has disadvantage.

Restrained: A restrained creature’s speed becomes 0, and it can’t benefit from any bonus to its speed. Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature’s attack rolls have disadvantage. The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.

Stunned: A stunned creature is incapacitated, can’t move, and can speak only falteringly. The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws. Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.

Unconscious: An unconscious creature is incapacitated, can’t move or speak, and is unaware of its surroundings. The creature drops whatever it’s holding and falls prone. The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws. Attack rolls against the creature have advantage. Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.

Spellcasting
What Is a Spell?
A spell is a discrete magical effect, a single shaping of the magical energies that suffuse the multiverse into a specific, limited expression. In casting a spell, a character carefully plucks at the invisible strands of raw magic suffusing the world, pins them in place in a particular pattern, sets them vibrating in a specific way, and then releases them to unleash the desired effect.

Spell Level
Every spell has a level from 0 to 9. A spell’s level is a general indicator of how powerful it is. Cantrips—simple but powerful spells that characters can cast almost by rote—are level 0.

Casting a Spell
When a character casts any spell, the same basic rules are followed, regardless of the character’s class or the spell’s effects. Each spell description begins with a block of information, including the spell’s name, level, school of magic, casting time, range, components, and duration.

Casting Time: Most spells require a single action to cast, but some spells require a bonus action, a reaction, or much more time to cast.

Range: The target of a spell must be within the spell’s range. For a spell like magic missile, the target is a creature. For a spell like fireball, the target is the point in space where the ball of fire erupts.

Components: A spell’s components are the physical requirements you must meet in order to cast it.

Verbal (V): Most spells require the chanting of mystic words.

Somatic (S): Spellcasting gestures might include a forceful gesticulation or an intricate set of gestures.

Material (M): Some spells require particular objects, specified in parentheses in the component entry.

Duration: A spell’s duration is the length of time the spell persists.

Concentration: Some spells require you to maintain concentration in order to keep their magic active. If you lose concentration, such a spell ends. Normal activity, such as moving and attacking, doesn’t interfere with concentration. The following factors can break concentration:

Casting another spell that requires concentration.

Taking damage.

Being incapacitated or killed.

Saving Throws
Many spells specify that a target can make a saving throw to avoid some or all of a spell’s effects. The DC to resist one of your spells equals 8 + your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus + any special modifiers.

Attack Rolls
Some spells require the caster to make an attack roll to determine whether the spell effect hits the intended target. Your attack bonus with a spell attack equals your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus.

Sword of Sharpness
Weapon (any sword), very rare (requires attunement)
When you attack an object with this magic sword and hit, maximize your weapon damage dice against the target. When you attack a creature with this weapon and roll a 20 on the attack roll, that target takes an extra 14 slashing damage. Then roll another d20. If you roll a 20, you lop off one of the target’s limbs, with the effect of such a loss determined by the GM. If the creature has no limb to sever, you lop off a portion of its body instead.

Vorpal Sword
Weapon (any sword), legendary (requires attunement)
You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. In addition, the weapon ignores resistance to slashing damage. When you attack a creature that has at least one head with this sword and roll a 20 on the attack roll, you cut off one of the creature’s heads. The creature dies if it can’t survive without the lost head.
